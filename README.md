In this repo an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL was created.
My app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## Technologies
MySQL<br>
Node.js<br>
Javascript<br>
NPM Packages<br>

## Example of Node Commands:
<strong>Comazon Customer's</strong><br>

## Launch
```
$ npm install mysql
$ npm install inquirer
$ npm install cli-table
```

## Future Development
For future development I would love to incoporate an Supervisor's database which includes a column for the Departments within the Comazon Store App. Along with perfecting the Comazon's Customer and Manager functionality.
